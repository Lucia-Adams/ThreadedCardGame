To run our tests, they should be opened in the latest version of BlueJ.
This can be done by opening the BlueJ Project File "package". 
The project should be compiled when opened and then the ‘run tests’ tool should be used.
This can be found under the tools menu in ‘testing’ or using CTRL + Shift + T in
Windows or CMD + Shift + T on Mac.
